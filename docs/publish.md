# Publication

We use `release-it` to generate release change and publish release on github and npm.

### Publish new patch version

```
npx release-it patch
```

### Publish new minor version

```
npx release-it minor
```

### Publish new major version

```
npx release-it major
```

### Publish a pre-release

```
npx release-it minor --preRelease=rc
```
